# My Python shell!

Features implemented so far (special thanks to Kamal Marhubi and Tom Ballinger for their help):

## 1. Custom input prompt

## 2. Exec-ing simple commands using os.fork() and os.execvp() 

## 3. Exec-ing builtins: cd (others to be added)

## 4. Pipelines of arbitrary length using os.pipe() and os.dup2() 

## 5. I/O redirection to/from files

To-do ideas (at this point, from Kamal, but I hope to add to this list):

### Variable expansion (path, environment etc)

### Running processes in the background

###
